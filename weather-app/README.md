Here's a fun challenge that makes a great GitHub project:

## CLI Weather Dashboard

Build a command-line weather app that fetches and displays weather data with a nice ASCII art interface.

**Requirements:**

- Accept a city name as a command-line argument
- Fetch current weather from a free API (like OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI)
- Display results with ASCII art weather icons (sun, clouds, rain, etc.)
- Show temperature, conditions, humidity, and wind speed
- Color-code output using chalk or similar library
- Handle errors gracefully (invalid city, network issues)

**Bonus features:**

- Save favorite cities to a config file
- Show a 3-day forecast
- Add temperature unit conversion (C/F)
- Make it installable globally with npm

**Tech stack:**

- Node.js
- `node-fetch` or `axios` for API calls
- `chalk` for colors
- `commander` or `yargs` for CLI parsing
- `dotenv` for API key management

This is perfect for GitHub because:

- It's practical and demonstrates API integration
- Shows you can build CLI tools
- Small enough to finish in a few hours
- Easy to extend with more features later
- Makes a nice README with screenshots

Want me to help you get started with the initial setup or have a different type of project in mind?
